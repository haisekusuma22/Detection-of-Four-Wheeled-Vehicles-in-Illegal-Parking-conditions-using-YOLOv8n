# Detection-of-Four-Wheeled-Vehicles-in-Illegal-Parking-conditions-using-YOLOv8n
Transportation plays a vital role in daily life, facilitating travel, goods distribution, and commerce. Public and private transportation are the two main options, with many favoring private vehicles like cars for their comfort and flexibility. However, illegal parking remains a common issue. This study suggests a remedy using the YOLOv8n object detection model and CCTV images to identify unlawfully parked four-wheeled vehicles. YOLOv8n employs deep learning for real-time object detection, enabling cameras to detect parking violations and alert traffic authorities. The model was trained on 5200 vehicle images from Roboflow Universe, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score exceeding 0.94. It effectively predicts parking status with around 58% accuracy. Validation results indicate that the model performs well on unseen datasets. Thus, this research contributes significantly to addressing illegal parking and enhancing urban traffic flow.
